# 0x07. Networking Basics

## Overview
This project focuses on foundational concepts in computer networking, particularly the OSI model, types of networks, IP addressing, and TCP/UDP protocols. The project aims to provide a solid understanding of how data is transmitted over networks, how different types of networks interact, and the essential tools used for network communication.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Explain the OSI model and its layers.
- Differentiate between LAN, WAN, and the Internet.
- Understand IP addressing, including IPv4, IPv6, and MAC addresses.
- Describe the differences between TCP and UDP, and know when to use each.
- Identify common TCP/UDP ports such as SSH (22), HTTP (80), and HTTPS (443).
- Utilize network tools like `netstat` and `ping` for network diagnostics.

## Key Tasks
1. **OSI Model:** Understand and explain the structure and purpose of the OSI model.
2. **Types of Networks:** Identify and differentiate between LAN, WAN, and Internet networks.
3. **MAC and IP Addresses:** Explain the significance of MAC and IP addresses in network communication.
4. **TCP and UDP:** Compare TCP and UDP protocols and understand their use cases.
5. **TCP/UDP Ports:** List common port numbers and write a Bash script to display listening ports.
6. **Ping Tool:** Write a Bash script that pings a given IP address to check network connectivity.

## Requirements
- All Bash scripts must be executable and pass `shellcheck` without errors.
- Scripts should start with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and include a comment explaining their functionality.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory for the project.
